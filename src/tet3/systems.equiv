# SCCS:   	@(#)systems.equiv	1.5 05/07/13 TETware release 3.8
# NAME:		systems.equiv
# PRODUCT:	TETware
# AUTHOR:	Andrew Dingwall, UniSoft Ltd.
# DATE CREATED:	June 1992
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	example systems.equiv file for the TETware INET implementation
#
#	each entry in this file permits one or more systems to log on
#	to the tccd daemon by specifying the host name or IP address
#	of one system that is allowed access, or a domain name
#	(beginning with a dot) to allow access by all systems in that
#	domain, or a network subnet (an address including trailing zeros
#	then a slash and the mask length) to allow access by all systems
#	on that subnet
#
#	an entry should be included in this file to enable the tcc which
#	runs on a particular system to log on to tccd on that system
#
#	a systems.equiv file should exist in the home directory for
#	the user tet (as specified in /etc/passwd), on each system
#	that runs tccd
#
#	if tccd is invoked with the -u option to use a different user ID,
#	the systems.equiv file should instead exist in the home directory
#	of the specified user
#
# MODIFICATIONS:
#
#	Geoff Clare, The Open Group, July 2005
#	Added support for domains and subnets.
